# What is an algorithm-
# A set of instructions to complete a task
#example 
name = input("yo whats is your name:\n")
print ("hello", name)
#example 
# Treyson has 12 apples, he has 5 friends that he wants to give apples to.
#how many apples does each friend get?
apples = 12
friends = 5
print("eachfriend gets", apples//friends, "apples !")

#List steps in an algorithm-
# step one- variables (get needed info)
# step two- do the equations (do the things)
# step thre- display results
#example 
# Average age of a group of 4 people
friend1 = 12 
friend2 = 15
friend3 = 18
friend4 = 16
all_together = friend1 + friend2 + friend3 + friend4
average = (all_together // 4)
print("average age of every friend", average, "years of age")

#List ALL of the different mathematical operators (Give me the symbol and tell me what it does) -
#intergers = whole numbers
#flouts = numbers with decimal
#examples
num1 = int(input("tell me what to do (number):\n"))
num2 = float(input("one more:\n"))
print("add (+)", num1 + num2)
print("subtract (-)", num1 - num2)
print("mutiply (*)", num1 * num2)
print("divid (/)", num1 / num2)
print("exponet (**)" ,num1 ** num2)
print("interger division (//)", num1 // num2)
print("divid with round (/)", round(num1 / num2, 2)) #rounding = getting rid of all the float exempe for number put after
print("modulo (%)", num1 % num2)

#List ALL of the different assignment operators (Give me the symbols and what it does) -
# the assignment operator is just the equal sign
#example
num1 +=  num2 
print("add (+)", num1)
num1 -=  num2 
print("subtract (-)", num1)
num1 *=  num2 
print("multiply (*)", num1)
num1 /=  num2 
print("divid (/)", num1)
num1 **=  num2 
print("exponet (**)" ,num1)
num1 //=  num2 
print("interger division (//)", num1)
num1 /=  num2 
print("divid with round (/)", round(num1, 2)) #rounding = getting rid of all the float unless told not to for number put after
num1 %=  num2 
print("modulo (%)", num1)
#example for float and int
#num1 = int(input("tell me what to do (number):\n"))
#num2 = float(input("one more:\n"))

#Why are expressions so important in programming-
#because it allows us to use less wording there for making it easy to look at
