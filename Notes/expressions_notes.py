# What is an algorithm-
# A set of instructions to complete a task
#example 
name = input("yo whats is your name:\n")
print ("hello", name)
#example 
# Treyson has 12 apples, he has 5 friends that he wants to give apples to.
#how many apples does each friend get?
apples = 12
friends = 5
print("eachfriend gets", apples//friends, "apples !")

#List steps in an algorithm-
# step one- variables (get needed info)
# step two- do the equations (do the things)
# step thre- display results
#example 
# Average age of a group of 4 people
friend1 = 12 
friend2 = 15
friend3 = 18
friend4 = 16
all_together = friend1 + friend2 + friend3 + friend4
average = (all_together // 4)
print("average age of every friend", average)

#List ALL of the different mathematical operators (Give me the symbol and tell me what it does) -
#intergers = whole numbers
#flouts = numbers with decimal
#examples
num1 = 3
num2 = 7
print("add (+)", num1 + num2)
print("subtract (-)", num1 - num2)
print("mutiply (*)", num1 * num2)
print("divid (/)", num1 / num2)
print("exponet (**)" ,num1 ** num2)
print("interger division (//)", num1 // num2)
print("modulo (%)", num1 % num2)

#List ALL of the different assignment operators (Give me the symbols and what it does) -
# why

#Why are expressions so important in programming-
